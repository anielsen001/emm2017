#+TITLE: Enhanced Magnetic Model 2017

This is a copy of the Enhanced Magnetic Model 2017 source code from NOAA. The original can be found here: https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/EMM/

The python wrapper and subroutine are in the spirit of https://github.com/space-physics/wmm2020 but not as fancy or polished.
